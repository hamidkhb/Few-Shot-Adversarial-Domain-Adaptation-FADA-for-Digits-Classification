# Few-Shot-Adversarial-Domain-Adaptation-FADA-for-Digits-Classification

This is the implementation of the paper [Few-Shot Adversarial Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02536) by Motiian et al. 
For this implementation the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) digit dataset has been used as source domain and [USPS](https://www.kaggle.com/bistaumanga/usps-dataset) as target domain. 

The code can be used with ` python main() --n_source=10 --n_target=5`, where the arguments represent the number of samples per class in the source and target domain respectively.
